**Motion Detection Implementation:** The motion detection subsystem utilizes GPIO interrupt capabilities to provide immediate response to PIR sensor activation. The sensor output is configured as an external interrupt source with rising edge triggering, corresponding to the sensor's active-high output signal. Debouncing logic prevents false triggers from electrical noise or mechanical vibration.

```cpp
void IRAM_ATTR motionDetected() {
  motionFlag = true;
  lastMotionTime = millis();
}

void setup() {
  pinMode(PIR_PIN, INPUT);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(PIR_PIN), motionDetected, RISING);
}
```

```cpp
camera_fb_t* captureImage() {
  camera_fb_t* fb = esp_camera_fb_get();
  if (!fb) {
    Serial.println("Camera capture failed");
    return nullptr;
  }
  
  Serial.printf("Picture taken! Size: %zu bytes\n", fb->len);
  return fb;
}
```

```cpp
void connectToWiFi() {
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
    if (millis() - wifiConnectStart > WIFI_TIMEOUT) {
      Serial.println("WiFi connection timeout");
      return;
    }
  }
  Serial.println("WiFi connected");
}
```

```cpp
bool uploadImageToFirebase(uint8_t* imageBuffer, size_t imageLength) {
  String imagePath = "/images/motion_" + String(millis()) + ".jpg";
  
  if (Firebase.Storage.upload(&storage, imagePath.c_str(), 
                              imageBuffer, imageLength, "image/jpeg")) {
    Serial.printf("Upload success: %s\n", storage.downloadURL().c_str());
    return true;
  } else {
    Serial.println("Upload failed: " + storage.errorReason());
    return false;
  }
}
```

Real-time database operations store alert metadata including timestamps, image URLs, and location information. The database structure is optimized for efficient querying and real-time synchronization with mobile applications. Database security rules ensure that only authenticated devices can write alert data.

**Power Management Implementation:** Power management features are implemented to extend battery life and reduce overall energy consumption. The ESP32's deep sleep capability is utilized during idle periods, with wake-up triggered by PIR sensor interrupts or timer expiration for periodic status updates.

Sleep mode transitions are carefully managed to ensure that all critical operations are completed before entering low-power states. Image transmission and database updates are prioritized to prevent data loss during power management transitions.

```cpp
void enterDeepSleep() {
  Serial.println("Entering deep sleep mode");
  esp_sleep_enable_ext0_wakeup(GPIO_NUM_13, 1); // Wake on PIR trigger
  esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup(SLEEP_DURATION * 1000000); // Wake every hour
  esp_deep_sleep_start();
}
```

Dynamic frequency scaling adjusts processor clock speeds based on current processing requirements. During image capture and transmission, full 240MHz operation ensures optimal performance. During idle monitoring, reduced clock speeds conserve power while maintaining adequate responsiveness.
