## Todo List for IoT Security System Project

### Phase 1: Research and design system architecture
- [x] Research suitable IoT platforms and components (ESP32-CAM, PIR sensor, cloud services).
- [x] Design the overall system architecture, including data flow and communication protocols.
- [x] Document the chosen components and architectural design.

### Phase 2: Develop hardware implementation code
- [x] Write code for ESP32-CAM to detect motion using PIR sensor.
- [x] Implement image capture functionality on motion detection.
- [x] Develop code to send captured images and alerts to a cloud service.

### Phase 3: Create mobile application interface
- [x] Design the user interface for the mobile application.
- [x] Develop the mobile application to receive and display alerts.
- [x] Implement functionality to display captured images within the app.

### Phase 4: Implement cloud messaging and backend services
- [x] Set up the chosen cloud messaging/API service (e.g., Firebase, Blynk).
- [x] Configure the backend to receive data from the ESP32-CAM.
- [x] Implement logic to push notifications to the mobile application.

### Phase 5: Create comprehensive documentation and setup guid- [x] Write a detailed project report covering all aspects of the system.
- [x] Create a step-by-step setup guide for hardware and software.
- [x] Generate system architecture diagrams and visual documentation.
- [x] Document troubleshooting procedures and maintenance guidelines.- [x] Compile all code, documentation, and necessary files into a single package.
- [x] Provide clear instructions for accessing and deploying the project.
- [x] Deliver the final project to the user.
